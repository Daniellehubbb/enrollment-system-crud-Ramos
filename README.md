Project Title and Description:
Student Enrollment System
A simple database-driven Student Enrollment System designed to manage student records, courses, and enrollments.   
This project uses MySQL as the database, PHP as the API backend, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend interface.   
The system provides administrators with the ability to add, edit, and delete student records. It also allows management
of academic information such as programs, years, semesters, and subjects. Through the enrollment feature, students can
be enrolled in specific programs and subjects, and their enrollment records can be viewed and updated as needed.
The interface is designed with a user-friendly tab navigation, making it easier to switch between different sections of the system.
